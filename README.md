# Design principle - Draft

**Design principles**

- Inspired by the colour of our stories
- Content first
- Simple & straightforward
- Bold
- Friendly & accessible
- Consistent

**UI design recommendations**

- Avoid placing UI elements on the image, except on the marketing banner or layout.
- Avoid decorative treatments like Corner radius, Shadows, Additional outlines, Decorative elements (e.g., lines that don’t serve a hierarchical or organizational purpose), and Icons that don’t help identify contents.
- Use lines to separate content from other content or to highlight the content between headlines and content. Only use lines when they are necessary and when negative space is not sufficient.
- Try to match our combination type styles (detailed information is in the Typography section). You can pair the same size or type sizes from the same category (this means they have a 1.9 ratio). This mainly refers to titles & headlines, not UI elements.
- Make sufficient negative space. Avoid making dense UI elements layouts in insufficient containers or boxes.
- Make sure to allow the content to take center stage by removing distracting elements and not covering up content.
- We avoid shadows completely and use thin 1px lines to separate hierarchies instead.
- To provide a clear focus, avoid stacking items in the grid so that they create a mosaic layout.
- Use sufficient contrast (for a11y guidelines from WCAG) to guide and direct attention.
- The RTL united brand aims to create a clear focus by limiting the amount of content that is prominently visible to an easily digestible amount. Less is more. Avoid adding functions and elements that are not required.
